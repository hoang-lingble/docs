**Hero CTA**

- White solid-filled button provides the highest possible contrast against a dark denim or industrial background, making the Call to Action (CTA) immediately discoverable.
- A full rounded (pill-shaped) button might look too "tech SaaS", small border radius (e.g., 2px to 4 px) to match the denim aesthetic.

**Product Cards**

- Convert static category images into shoppable slots. Changing customers' mental model from "I have to browse a category" to "Here is something I can buy right now."
- Show 3-4 mini product images inside the card with prices to drive immediate clicks.

**3-Column Grid**

- 3-column allows the center card to act as a primary focal point, creating a balanced "triad" of information without feeling cluttered.
- Use this for story-telling (About Us, Craftmanship, Lookbook). For a heritage brand like Japan Blue, the "About Us" and collection stories are vital differentiators.
- Ensure the imagery is distinct from the product photos to differentiate "Shopping" from "Learning".
