### Make All Banners Fully Clickable

Issue: Partial click zones violate affordance expectations. Users assume banners are clickable end-to-end.

Suggestion: Entire banner area should link to a clear destination.

### Fix Filter Panel Auto-Close

Issue: Auto-closing filters interrupt task flow and violate user control heuristics. Especially damaging on mobile and PLPs with multi-attribute filtering.

Suggestion: Filters should persist until explicitly closed.

### Fix Price Slider Overlap (Apply / Clear buttons)

Issue: Overlapping controls are a **functional defect**, not just UX polish. This directly blocks filtering, which blocks conversion.

Suggestion: Ensure fixed positioning or sufficient bottom padding.
