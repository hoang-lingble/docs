### [MJL-394](https://lingble.atlassian.net/browse/MJL-394) Checkout page sometimes not able to proceed

The checkout process intermittently fails, preventing users from completing their purchase. The issue appears to be related to cart/session integrity and a broken guest checkout flow.

**Possible Root Causes:**

- **Cart Invalidation**: Likely a session integrity issue or a server-side validation failure where the cart object is being prematurely invalidated or a data mismatch is detected between the session and the product catalog at the moment of checkout initiation. This is the probable cause of the user's "sometimes not able to proceed" report.
- **Guest Checkout**: The "Continue to Shipping" button is either incorrectly configured or an underlying script is triggering a forced redirection to the login page, completely bypassing the guest checkout flow.
- **Input Field:** The email input field `id="email-guest"`) was unresponsive to standard browser input methods, suggesting a minor front-end event handler bug (workaround required a direct JavaScript console command).
